# banjo
Out of the box, Django - as a python library, meets both of the objectives of this project. Django and python have a low bar of entry for beginners. **banjo** will form the basis of a working prototype; a proof of concept that can also be used as a working solution. It is expected that we will take this project only so far; so as to meet the requirements of objective 2.

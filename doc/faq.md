# elioThing FAQ
## What is a Thing?
A Thing is an "object, being, or entity" _[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing)_ or "the most generic type of item" _[schema.org](https://schema.org/Thing)_. It is the highest class of data in **elioThing** and any Thing contains properties such as "name", "description" and "image". Everything _inherits_ those properties from Thing. Literally everything is a Thing.

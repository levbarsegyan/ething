# elioSin FAQ
## Can you say something nice about me again?
- You are enchanting and eager and evil.
## What is sin?
Sin is the ideological belief that ones morality is determined by the extent to which your behaviour offends God.
## What is elioSin?
- **elioSin** is SASS driven, gridless, auto-scaling, CSS styled, HTML wireframe tool focused on tag names, not classes, aimed at the slothful. It is not intended as a replacement for Bootstrap or Pure or any "grid" system frameworks.
- **elioSin** is here so that developers can quickly spin up a wireframe for their apps which look similar to Bootstrap, etc, but without the HTML crud. Developers can use**elioSin** to immediately get focused on coding its features.
- **elioSin** is perfect for single page apps, prototypes or blog sites which don't need pretty complex layouts.
## Why sin?
- **elioSin** because I'm a web developer who sometimes prefers creating feature-rich applications over tweaking page-layouts. I hate it when I start a new project, eager with ideas for features, only to get bogged down first wireframing a webpage to work in. **elioSin** gives me a pattern I can return to.
There is an immediacy to **elioSin** that I hope other developers will appreciate.
## Why elioSin?
- **elioSin** was originally called "floaters". I changed it because I thought the imagery of "heaven" and "hell" makes it clear there should be a reason why you would choose the "right" over the "left" gutter. People find new patterns easier if there's already a pattern they recognise.
- **elioSin** makes it clear which modules are the back bone; the modularity of **elioSin** is self-explained.

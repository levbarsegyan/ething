> Are you ready for any thing? **the elioWay**
![experminental](https://elioway.gitlab.io/img/experimental.png "experminental")
As with [elioSin](https://elioway.gitlab.io/eliosin), **elioThing** is designed to meet two objectives:
1. **Goal focused** Provide a suite of applications driven by Schema.org data models. These will be focused on information capture with ease and dissemination meeting the objects of Schema.org's intentions, and compliant with its specifications of structured, semantic markup.
2. **Learning focused** We intentionally break the technologies into easily consumed, bitsized modules that can be understood by new developers and maintained by the inexperienced.
Contributors welcome.
## banjo
Out of the box, Django - as a python library, meets both of the objectives of this project. Django and python have a low bar of entry for beginners. **banjo** will form the basis of a working prototype; a proof of concept that can also be used as a working solution. It is expected that we will take this project only so far; so as to meet the requirements of objective 2.

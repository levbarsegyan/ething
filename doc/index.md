![experimental](https://elioway.gitlab.io/static/experimental.png "experimental")
As with [elioSin](https://elioway.gitlab.io/eliosin), **elioThing** is designed to meet two objectives:
1. **Goal focused** Provide a suite of applications driven by Schema.org data models. These will be focused on information capture with ease and dissemination meeting the objects of Schema.org's intentions, and compliant with its specifications of structured, semantic markup.
2. **Learning focused** We intentionally break the technologies into easily consumed, bitsized modules that can be understood by new developers and maintained by the inexperienced.
Contributors welcome.

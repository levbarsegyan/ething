**toothpaste** extends **god** with an apocalyptic and simple rule. tagNames in heaven, and tagNames in hell switch alteratively from hell to heaven.

## Nutshell
`toothpaste` - in principle - work in elioWays:
- ... when `menu`, `nav` `blockquote` are in hell.
- ... when `aside`, `button` `figure` are in hell.
- ... put `blockquote` and `figure` into toothpaste.
- Now `blockquote` and `figure` tag will alternate from heaven to hell.
## toothpaste's only commandment is:
1. **toothpaste** only works in heaven and hell
_Terms and conditions apply. The **god** retains the right to change these rules at a whim._
